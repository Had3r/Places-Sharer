# Places Sharer App

- This app allows users to share places where each place has an image, title and other small details with other users.
- The visitor is able to view the list of users and check shared places for a specific user.
- **The goal** of this app is to learn Node/Express and how to connect with React.

## Structure - frontend

Creating a common split of components into folders `components` and `pages` makes it difficult to find individual parts of the app. Instead of creating two main folders and then subfolders, I **splitted logic by feature**. It means that I have place related components in a places folder, user related components in a user folder and so on. `Shared` folder contain common components.

## Installation - frontend

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) to install and run.

```bash
npm install

npm start
```
